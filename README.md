## Introduction

The Tennis Analysis System aims to enhance the understanding of tennis matches through advanced computer vision techniques. By detecting and tracking players and the ball, this system provides valuable insights into player performance and game dynamics. The project employs various machine learning and deep learning methodologies to achieve its objectives.

## Key Components

1. **Object Detection**: Using YOLOv8 from the Ultralytics library to detect objects (players, tennis balls, etc.) in images and videos.
2. **Custom YOLO Training**: Fine-tuning and training a custom YOLO model on a specific dataset to improve detection accuracy.
3. **Key Point Extraction**: Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with PyTorch to extract key points of interest from detected objects.
4. **Object Tracking**: Implementing object tracking to maintain the identity of detected objects across video frames.
5. **Video Processing**: Utilizing OpenCV (CV2) for reading, manipulating, and saving video files.

## Implementation

### Object Detection with YOLO

1. **Using Ultralytics YOLOv8**: The project employs the Ultralytics implementation of YOLOv8 to detect objects in images and videos.
2. **Fine-tuning YOLO**: 
   - Prepare a custom dataset containing images of tennis players and balls.
   - Train the YOLOv8 model using the dataset to improve detection capabilities specific to tennis.

### Key Point Extraction

- Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to identify key points such as the ball. This information is crucial for analyzing player movements and shot techniques.

### Object Tracking

- Implement object tracking algorithms to follow the detected objects across frames, ensuring accurate analysis of player interactions and ball movements throughout the match.

### Video Processing

- Use OpenCV to read video files, manipulate frames (such as adding annotations or overlays), and save processed videos for further analysis.

### Consolidation of Results

- Integrate all outputs from the various models into a comprehensive system that delivers actionable insights. This could include visualizations, performance metrics, and reports that summarize the analysis.
